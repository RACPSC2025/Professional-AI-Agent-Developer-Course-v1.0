## <span style="color:#0078d4">Lesson 2.1: Exploration of AI Agent Frameworks</span>

### <span style="color:#0078d4">Introduction to AI Agent Frameworks</span>

AI agent frameworks are platforms that provide the tools, components, and architectures necessary to build, train, and deploy artificial intelligence agents. These frameworks simplify the development process by abstracting the complexity of low-level implementation and offering user-friendly interfaces for creating sophisticated agents.

### <span style="color:#0078d4">Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) - The Future of Microsoft Agents</span>

With the evolution of AI agent frameworks, Microsoft has consolidated its previous technologies (such as AutoGen and parts of Semantic Kernel) into the new Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF), representing Microsoft's primary approach to multi-agent development.
